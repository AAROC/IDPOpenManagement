IDPOpenManagement
=================


This repo contains the playbook used to install the IDP in our organisation
using the roles [shibboleth-idp-v3](https://galaxy.ansible.com/osct/shibboleth-idp-v3/)
and [tomcat-8](https://galaxy.ansible.com/osct/tomcat-8/).

The playbook is not a usage example or a skeleton for other but it
can be used as a reference to build your own playbook in case of deploying
service based on the above roles.
